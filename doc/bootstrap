NAME
  bootstrap - Bootstrap cc-progs

SYNOPSIS
  bootstrap
  bootstrap ROOT

DESCRIPTION
  Downloads cc-progs to ROOT if given, otherwise chooses /disk or /usr depending on whether the system seems to be ComputerCraft or OpenComputers, respectively.

  The default HTTP "root" is hard-coded as HTTP_ROOT; you can change it by editing the file. From this source, it downloads either `manifest.cc` or `manifest.oc` depending on detected system, and "executes" the manifest, line by line, as follows:

  1. If the line starts with an exclamation (!), a message is printed.

  2. Otherwise, the line contains two (non-whitespace) words, separated by a space, in the order "DESTINATION SOURCE", where ROOT/DESTINATION is downloaded from HTTP_ROOT/SOURCE.

  In order to defeat aggressive caches, a random number is automatically generated and appended as the "?rand=RAND" query parameter. The default HTTP_ROOT on Github simply ignores this parameter.
