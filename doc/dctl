SYNOPSIS
  dctl load NAME
  dctl start NAME ARGS...
  dctl stop INSTNAME
  dctl restart INSTNAME ARGS...
  dctl reload INSTNAME
  dctl unload NAME
  dctl list
  dctl show
  dctl available
  dctl avail
  dctl defaults NAME
  dctl logcat

DESCRIPTION
  dctl is the meta-command for libdaemon(1) management. The following commands are defined:

  load NAME

    Invokes libdaemon.try_load. Generally, this attempts to run a program named "NAME" or "NAME.lua" in libdaemon.DAEMON_PATH, which usually loads a template of the same name into libdaemon's registry.

  start NAME ARGS...

    Invokes start on a template with the given NAME. ARGS are passed to the template's :init(...) function, as strings from the command line. This also loads both the default configuration from the template, and any site-local configuration from `/etc/daemon/NAME`, which should be a table expression containing overrides for the default values. See `defaults` below.

  stop INSTNAME

    Stops an instance by name. (List instances with `show` or `list`.)

  restart INSTNAME ARGS...

    Stops an instance by name, then starts a new instance with the given ARGS, as with `start` above.

  reload INSTNAME

    Stops and instance by name, then starts a new instance with the same ARGS it was started with before. See `start` above.

  unload NAME

    Invokes libdaemon.remove, which removes a template from the registry. This is generally useful if the named daemon must be updated (e.g., when the source changes). Any running instances are unaffected.

  list
  show

    Shows the list of all loaded templates and their names, as well as all running instances and their names.

  available
  avail

	Invokes libdaemon.available, which guesses the names of templates that are available by listing executable files matching the libdaemon.DAEMON_PATH path. Note that this assumes that daemons are named exactly the same as the file in the filesystem.

  defaults NAME

    Prints out the default configuration for template NAME, if any. Note that this does not include any site-local configuration via `/etc/daemon/NAME`. See `start` above.

  logcat

	Prints events registered via libdaemon.log, which includes instance:log. These messages are also routed to `/tmp/daemon.log` by default, but you can view them in realtime by running this command. Press any key to exit.

EXAMPLES

  dctl load heartbeat
  dctl start heartbeat

    Loads and starts the `heartbeat` daemon (which emits a constant message on a configurable port in a configurable interval).

  dctl show
  dctl list

    Either will show the list of loaded daemons and running instances, if any.

  dctl reload heartbeat.1

    Stops instance `heartbeat.1` and starts a new instance with the same template and arguments (with a different instance name).

  dctl stop heartbeat.2

    Stops the `heartbeat.2` instance, if it is running.

  dctl avail
  dctl available

    Lists seemingly-executable daemon files in libdaemon.DAEMON_PATH.

  dctl logcat

    Follows the output of all daemon logs until a key is pressed.
