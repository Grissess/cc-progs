NAME
  ldapget - Get an LDAP record

SYNOPSIS
  ldapget [--host=HOST] PATH

DESCRIPTION
  Retrieves data under PATH served by the HOST LDAP server, which is a name resolved via liblldns(1). If HOST is not given, and libldap.CONFIG_FILE (usually `/etc/ldap.cfg`) exists, it is assumed to contain a table expression whose "host" key is set to the default LDAP server's LLDNS name.

  PATH may be any valid LDAP data path. You may need to take care to shell escape whitespace and quoted strings properly.

EXAMPLES
  ldapget --host=ldap ''
    Gets the entire database (root object) from the LDAP host named "ldap" via LLDNS.

  ldapget 'foo.bar.baz[3]'
    Gets the path 'foo.bar.baz[3]' from the LDAP host named as "host" in the default LDAP configuration (usually `/etc/ldap.cfg`). The "." accessor is a shorthand for string access, as with Lua, so this path is the same as '["foo"]["bar"]["baz"][3]' on the root object. See libldap(1).

BUGS
  Currently, ldapget can only work with a remote database, even though libldap(1) supports local databases transparently.
