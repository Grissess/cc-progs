NAME
  daemon_load - Load the default set of daemons

SYNOPSIS
  daemon_load

DESCRIPTION
  Intended to be run automatically (as with an RC script), this program loads libdaemon(1) and reads `/etc/daemon.cfg`, which is expected to contain a Lua table expression. The following keys have meaning:

  start={...}

    Start the named daemons automatically. The key is the name of a daemon, and the value is ignored (true is a popular value). For example, start={foo=true, bar=true} will start the `foo` and `bar` daemons when this script is run.

  daemon_load logs to `/tmp/daemon_load.log`, since it may not be running with proper IO redirects. Reviewing the file may be useful to debug service startup issues.

SEE ALSO
  libdaemon(1), dctl(1)
