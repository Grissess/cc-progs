NAME
  mbroadcast - broadcast a string message on a modem port

SYNOPSIS
  mbroadcast PORT STRING ...

DESCRIPTION
  Broadcasts one or more strings on the modem on the given port. The port need not be open to do so, but only modems with the port open will receive the message.

EXAMPLES
  mbroadcast 12345 foo "test logged message"
    Broadcasts to listening modems on port 12345 (the default libdaemon log port) two strings, loosely interpreted as "facility" foo, and message "test logged message". Note the quotes used to capture spaces.
