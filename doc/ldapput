NAME
  ldapput - Sets an LDAP record

SYNOPSIS
  ldapput [--host=HOST] [--version=VERSION] PATH VALUE

DESCRIPTION
  Sets the value VALUE to exist under the path PATH in the HOST LDAP server, which is a name resolved via liblldns(1). The immediate parent of PATH must exist, and be a table, and the VERSION, if given, must match the current data revision as retrieved with the last get request.

  If HOST is not given, and libldap.CONFIG_FILE (usually `/etc/ldap.cfg`) exists, it is assumed to contain a table expression whose "host" key is set to the default LDAP server's LLDNS name.

  PATH may be any valid LDAP data path. You may need to take care to shell escape whitespace and quoted strings properly.

  VALUE may be any Lua expression evaluated in an empty environment (as per serialization(1) .unserialize). You may need to shell escape this, as above.

EXAMPLES
  ldapset --host=ldap 'foo.bar' '{a=1, b=2}'
    Sets 'foo.bar' on the LDAP host named "ldap" to {a=1, b=2}--equivalently (as long as 'foo.bar' exists and is a table), sets 'foo.bar.a' to 1 and 'foo.bar.b' to 2, erasing any other keys and values associated with 'foo.bar'.

  ldapset --host=ldap --version=4 'foo.bar' '{a=1, b=2}'
    As above, but with explicit data version 4. The server may fail the request if the current revision is not 4, as it means that another modification raced with yours.

  ldapset 'foo.list[1]' 1234
    Sets 'foo.list[1]' to the number 1234, using the LDAP server named as "host" in the default LDAP configuration (usually `/etc/ldap.cfg`).

BUGS
  Currently, ldapset can only work with a remote database, even though libldap(1) supports local databases transparently.
