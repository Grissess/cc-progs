NAME
  wget - Get a file from the web

SYNOPSIS
  wget URI
  wget URI PATH

DESCRIPTION
  This is an OC/CC neutral implementation of wget, in case neither environment provides one; to my knowledge, both of them now do, but if you find yourself in a weird spot, you might be able to hack this into a system to port bootstrap(1) to it. Note that OC requires an Internet card for access, anyway.

  By default, PATH is the filename part of URI. This uses the internal filesystem libraries where possible, instead of parsing the actual URI, so be wary of issues related to that.

EXAMPLES
  wget http://example.com/ index.html
    Gets the contents of http://example.com/ (probably an HTML document) into the current working directory at `index.html`.

BUGS
  This probably doesn't handle URIs ending with trailing slashes, query parameters, fragments, etc. correctly.
