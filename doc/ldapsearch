NAME
  ldapsearch - Searches for matching LDAP records

SYNOPSIS
  ldapsearch [--host=HOST] [--base=BASE] FILTER

DESCRIPTION
  Finds entries in the LDAP database run on the HOST LDAP server (which is resolved via liblldns(1)) for which FILTER (a Lua expression) evaluates to true. Within FILTER, `self` is the current record.

  libldap(1)'s LDAP:search method does a deep preorder traversal, enumerating every pair within all reachable tables from the root object. `self` assumes the value from each pair. If the FILTER expression evaluates successfully and results in a true value, a result table of {path=PATH, value=self} is recorded, where PATH is a libldap.Path object representing the location of the associated value.

  If BASE is passed, it may be any valid LDAP data path; the search is restricted only to tables reachable from there. BASE is '' by default (the root object).

  If HOST is not given, and libldap.CONFIG_FILE (usually `/etc/ldap.cfg`) exists, it is assumed to contain a table expression whose "host" key is set to the default LDAP server's LLDNS name.

EXAMPLES
  ldapsearch --host=ldap 'true'
    Enumerates all values stored in the LDAP database served by the host named "ldap" via LLDNS. This can take a very long time!

  ldapsearch --host=ldap --base='foo.bar' 'self.service'
    Enumerates all values stored in the LDAP database served by the host named "ldap" via LLDNS that (1) have a service attribute (2) whose value can be interpreted as true by Lua (e.g., a table value, or the literal `true`) (3) under the table rooted at 'foo.bar'. This example shows that it is easy to tag records as participating in any type schema by simply adding a truthy attribute to it.

  ldapsearch 'self.kind == "user" and self.uid ~= 0'
    Searches the entire LDAP database served by the LDAP server named as "host" in the default LDAP configuration (usually `/etc/ldap.cfg`) for entries that (1) have an attribute "kind" equal to the string "user" and (2) have an attribute "uid" not equal to the number 0.

BUGS
  Currently, ldapset can only work with a remote database, even though libldap(1) supports local databases transparently.
